	<div class="entry-content"><p>The new operating system for Apple Watch, watchOS 2, was introduced a couple of weeks ago at WWDC 2015. It brings a lot of improvements, mostly for developers looking to create an Apple Watch app. These are the things that I find to be most important for developers:</p>

<ul>
<li>WatchKit apps are now running natively on the watch. This brings the much needed improvement in speed, resulting in a better user experience.</li>
<li>The new Watch Connectivity framework enables all sorts of communication and data sharing between the parent iOS app and the watchOS app.</li>
<li>watchOS 2 apps have access to hardware data, such as data from the motion sensor, audio recording, and they can even access heart rate data.</li>
<li>watchOS 2 also introduced animations. On watchOS 1, the only option to perform an animation was to generate a series of images and then iterate through them. watchOS 2 brings true animations to the Apple Watch. You can animate the user interface by changing layout properties inside an animation block. That’s where this tutorial comes in.</li>
</ul>


<h2>1. Why Care About Animations?</h2>

<p>Before we get to the nuts and bolts, I’d like to spend a minute talking about the purpose of animations on Apple Watch apps.</p>

<p>The obvious reason is that they make the user interface more enjoyable if used appropriately. And when it comes to Apple Watch, that is a big if. Since most app interactions only last for a few seconds, you really don’t want to go overboard with animations.</p>

<p>The second, and I believe more important reason, is that they allow for custom navigation hierarchies inside Apple Watch apps. Let&rsquo;s suppose you need to present a screen that the user can only leave by taking a specific action. Normally, Apple Watch apps always have a cancel button in the top left corner when a modal interface controller is presented. With animations and clever layout manipulation, you could create your own &ldquo;present view controller&rdquo; routine that shows your app&rsquo;s content full-screen, dismissing it by that specific action. That is one of the things you’ll learn in this tutorial.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>//Describe the animation in watchOS 1</p>

<p>The principle of animations on watchOS 2 is simple, you set one or more of the animatable properties inside an animation block. The following example illustrates how this works.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='swift'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">self</span> <span class="nl">animateWithDuration</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">0.5</span> <span class="nl">animations</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">circleGroup</span> <span class="nl">setHorizontalAlignment</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">WKInterfaceObjectHorizontalAlignmentRight</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This method causes the circleGroup to be aligned to the right, with an animation with a duration of 0.5 seconds. As you can see, we are calling animateWithDuration:animations: on self, which is an instance of WKInterfaceController. This is different from iOS where the animation methods are class methods on UIView.</p>

<p>The below list shows which properties are animatable:</p>

<p>.opacity</p>

<p>.alignment</p>

<p>.width and height</p>

<p>.background color</p>

<p>.color and tint color</p>

<p>Bear in mind that it’s still not possible on watchOS 2 to create user interface elements at runtime. But since you can hide them or set their alpha to 0 in the storyboard, this shouldn’t be that big of a problem.</p>

<p>That’s it. Armed with your knowledge about the WatchKit layout system, you are now ready to start working with native animations on watchOS. Let’s get started by creating a sample app so I can show you a couple of examples of how this all fits together.</p>
